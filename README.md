Hey there, I'm AntidevStorm, or just call me Storm! I'm your friendly neighborhood developer, rocking out in a bunch of programming languages. 
Don't let the whole "professional" vibe fool youâ€”I'm as nice and easygoing as they come. 
If any of my scripts decide to throw a little tantrum, no worries, I've got your back and will help you sort it out.

# Languages:
## Lua
> I'm the Lua maestro, and I've got my hands on Luau and some cool public modules like LOVE and more.
# Python
> My sweet spot, especially when I'm dancing with the stars using the "Pygame" module.
## All C Languages
> Modules might not be my BFF, but I'm rocking it with the OG languages.
## Web Languages
> HTML5: My first love and I speak it fluently!
> 
> CSS3: I've got some cool moves in this dance too.
> 
> JS and TS: I can groove with intermediate scripts in TypeScript, but I'm the real party animal in JavaScript.
## Java
> Yep, I know my way around Java too.
# Fun Fact About Me:
I'm always up for a good time, especially when it comes to crafting game-modifying scripts. 
It's not just about coding; it's about creating something awesome together.
